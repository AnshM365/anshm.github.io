        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome! I'm Ansh Manchanda, a passionate BCom Info Tech student at York University. I have a deep fascination with technology and a love for working on computers. Over time, I've found immense joy in learning about the ever-evolving world of technology and connecting with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>My academic journey is fueled by the desire to understand the intricate workings of technology and its application in our daily lives. When I'm not immersed in my studies or exploring the latest tech trends, you'll find me enjoying quality time with my friends. I believe in balancing hard work with a vibrant social life. It's these moments of relaxation and camaraderie that truly enrich my life.</p>
